Far Far Far better creative inventory

Users can use the creative inventory if:
	the server is in creative mode OR
	the user has the "creative" priv

by default, it will be fairly slow to use, but by clicking "settings"-->one of the sort settings or "settings"-->one of the view settings

to make it mine craft-like select "sort by category" and "view as icons around inventory"
